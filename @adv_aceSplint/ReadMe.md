ADV - ACE Splint offers you an item you can use to fix damaged arms and legs.

The right folder name is \@adv_aceSplint\. If your folder name is any different, you might have gotten this mod from an unofficial source.

Of course it only works with ace_medical_healHitPointAfterAdvBandage disabled.

Settings can be changed with cba settings, or the following variables:
adv_aceSplint_reopenChance = 30;	//default 0, maximum value 100
adv_aceSplint_reopenTime = 300;		//default 600, minimum 30, with a certain random factor.
adv_aceSplint_reuseChance = 80;		//default 80, maximum value 100

The classname for the splint item is:
"adv_aceSplint_splint"

If you want to enable logging to rpt set this variable:
adv_aceSplint_diag = true;
